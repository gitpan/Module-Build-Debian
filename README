NAME
    Module::Build::Debian - Module::Build extension to build .deb packages
    using "dh-make-perl".

VERSION
    This document describes Module::Build::Debian version 1.0.0.

SYNOPSIS
        # In your Module::Build subclass:

            # We use eval because we only want the feature if
            # Module::Build::Debian is actually installed.
            BEGIN {
                eval 'use Module::Build::Debian';
            }

        # Then, you can use Build.PL to create a debian package of the module: 
    
            $ perl Build.PL
    
            $ ./Build debian
    
            $ ./Build debianclean
